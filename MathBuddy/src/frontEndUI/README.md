# MathBuddy
MathBuddy will be an app where students of all ages can access an infinite number of practice problems
relevant to their skill, to help hone their math abilities so that they have a strong foundation and
understanding of arithmetic. MathBuddy takes young learners on a journey which allows them to
master concepts such as arithmetic, value comparison, and algebra.

Through multiple challenge levels and occasional checkpoints, students will become more comfortable
with mathematics. The journey behins with single-digit arithmetic concepts, then move to comparing
fractions and analyzing rations, then finally to solving linear equations. A smooth level progression in
each problem type guides students while providing a gentle growth that builds confidence.

MathBuddy also assists teachers with educating their students. The program provides flashcard-like
quizzes which provide reports and other detailed feedback to track progress and provide study
suggestions. Timed challenges, that will occur at certain intervals, ensures that mastery is demonstrated
at each level. MathBuddy is a flexible, yet complete solution for various parties that will allow students
and teachers to excel in today's evolving education environment.
